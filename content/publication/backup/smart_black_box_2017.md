abstract = "Autonomous vehicles require reliable and resilient sensor suites and ongoing validation through fleet-wide data collection. This paper proposes a Smart Black Box (SBB) to augment traditional low-bandwidth data storage logging with value-driven high-bandwidth data capture. Data time histories associated with unexpected signals, high-risk, or anomalous conditions are stored in long-term memory and later uplinked to the cloud. This paper proposes and applies anomaly detection metrics for identifying high-value driving data. A series of driving tests with raw data capture and an off-the-shelf automotive driver assistance system enables data analysis with respect to object identification accuracy and completeness."
